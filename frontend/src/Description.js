            If you write code, whether you're newbie learning to code, or a working professional in the tech industry, we all have something we like. We like to write code and build things.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Before we start building anything, we have to learn the right technologies. As we do this, we search for tutorials, videos, forums, and documentation, but it takes a while to find the right resource that's most helpful to us. We have to search multiple websites before we find one that works for us. Some websites may be outdated, some may be targeted towards experienced coders when you're a beginner, so just may be hard for you personally to understand.
